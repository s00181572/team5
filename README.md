Boiling Sensor

This is a prototype of our proposed idea for Project 1.
The purpose is to time the boiling duration of food.
Our group had eggs in mind for this project although it can be used for other food as well.

There are three main applications:
Buzzer
Button
LED light

The functionality of this idea is pretty simple.
The button is pressed, and a timer starts.
This timer is 120 seconds long, or 2 minutes.
For the entire duration, the LED will light up with a specified colour.
When the timer ends, The buzzer will go off for a few moments.
The LED will also blink for a few moments.
